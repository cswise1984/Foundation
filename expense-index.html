            <h1>Continuing Development: Expense Track</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to your continuing development program! We’re excited to be offering this program as we know how
                challenging it can be to learn Foundation on your own.</p>
            <h3>Expense Track Goals</h3>
            <p>The objective of this program is to provide participants with a better understanding of how Foundation
                tracks
                expenses throughout the system. The following things will be covered in this program:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr id="exprow1">
                        <th>Base Modules: PS, AP, PR, GL, JC</th>
                        <th>Additional Modules: EQ, FA, IN, SD</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr id="exprow2">
                        <td>- Best practices for expense tracking</td>
                        <td>- Explain the module's purpose</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr id="exprow3">
                        <td>- Showing how expenses flow through the base modules</td>
                        <td>- Best practices for module setup and expense tracking</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr id="exprow4">
                        <td rowspan="2"></td>
                        <td>- Best practices for processing daily transactions</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr id="exprow5">
                        <td>- Showing how expenses flow through the additional and base modules</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            <h3>A Work in Progress</h3>
            <p>This is our first time implementing an extended development program outside of new hire training. Like
                anything else, it will take a lot of time and eff ort to make this program great, and the program you’re
                participating in is new.</p>
            <p>In implementing this program we’re doing our best to balance a lot of factors like keeping class sizes
                small and
                making sure that clients are still served while we educate our staff. However, we plan to continuously
                improve
                this program. We may occasionally ask you for feedback on the eff ectiveness of this program though an
                anonymous
                survey, but we’re open to receiving feedback from you at any point in time. Please feel free to send any
                feedback on these programs to Chris Kundmueller.</p>
            <h3>Classroom Guidelines</h3>
            <p>We want to lay out our expectations for the class so that everyone can get the most out of it.</p>
            <ol>
                <strong>
                    <li>Make the Class Time Count:
                </strong> You’ll only be meeting as a group once a week for two hours so it’s important to make the most
                of this
                class time. Please make sure you’re in the classroom and ready to learn at 8:00 AM.</li>
                <strong>
                    <li>This Isn’t a Lecture:
                </strong> These programs are designed to be interactive. Smaller class sizes give you the opportunity to
                ask
                questions and participate in discussions and your facilitator is expecting to hear your knowledge and
                experiences on the topic.</li>
                <strong>
                    <li>Learning Outside the Classroom:
                </strong> You’ll get the most out of this program if you apply what you’re learning when helping clients
                and
                then bring those experiences back into the classroom the following week.</li>
            </ol>
