      <h1>What is “Good” Accounting?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>If we want to have a discussion about how to properly track expenses in Foundation we first need to understand
        what the distinction between good and bad accounting is. As you may have guessed, the answer isn’t black and
        white. One thing is for sure though, good accounting starts with a good chart of accounts.</p>

      <div class="exercise"><img src="./images/exercise.JPG" alt="Exercise" class="img-ex">
        <h3>Exercise: What Makes a Chart of Accounts Good?</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Most clients come to Foundation with a chart of accounts that isn’t optimal. They likely
        have accounts that won’t be necessary once they start using Foundation, multiple
        accounts that are tracking the same thing, or accounts that can be removed altogether.
        In this exercise, it will be your job to play the role of the accountant and clean up the
        chart of accounts.</p>
      <p>A few questions to keep in mind as we are taking a looking at a Chart of A ccount’s:
        <ul>
          <li>Does the Chart of Accounts have a numbering sequence?</li>
          <li>What (if any) accounts can you Combine to make the Chart of Accounts cleaned up?</li>
          <li>What (if any) accounts can you get rid of to make the Chart of Accounts condenced?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When working through a Chart of Accounts, either your own in Practice or with a Client,
        it is important to understand where to categorize certain accounts. This will be important when looking at
        reporting. The categories that are listed below is a basic structure that can be further broken down with in
        Foundation.</p>
      <p>Before we can start putting Numbers to accounts we should probably identifiy what categories we will want to
        break our accounts into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asset:</strong> Any resource owned by a company, and must be expected to generate buture benefit to
          a
          company. (What a company has)<br>
          <strong>Further Break out of Assets:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Current Assets [Bank Accounts, Accounts Receivables, Inventory, etc.]</li>
            <li>Fixed Assets [Buildings, Equipment, Land, Improvements, Depreciation/Amoritzation, etc.]</li>
            <li>Other Assets [Employee Advances, Bond Insurance Costs, Deferred Tax Assets, etc.]</li>
          </ol>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> A company's legal financial debts or obligations that arise during the course
          of business operations. (What a Company owes)<br>
          <strong>Further Break out of Liabilities:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Current Liabilities [Accounts Payables, Sales Tax Payable, Accrued Expenses, Accrued Payroll Taxes, etc.]</li>
            <li>Long Term Liabilities [Defered Tax Liabilities, Long Term Debt, Lines of Credit/Loans, etc.]</li>
          </ol>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> is the remaining value of an owner's interest in a company, after all liabilities
          have been deducted.<br />
          <strong>Further Breakdown</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Capital</li>
            <li>Treasury / Stock</li>
            <li>Retained Earnings</li>
          </ol>
        </li><br>
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> The revenue a business earns from selling its goods and services.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> The money spent, or costs incurred, by a business in their effort to generate revenues. 
          Essentially, accounts expenses represent the cost of doing business<br />
        <strong>Further Breakdown of Expenses</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Direct Expenses [Direct Labor, Materials, Subcontracts, etc.] - Easy to tie directly to a Project</li>
        <li>Indirect Expenses [Equipment Maintenance, Shop/Production Labor/Materials, etc.] - Not directly tied to a Project though
          still a cost of doing business</li>
        <li>Overhead Expenses [Office Labor, Office Supplies, Insurance, Utilities, etc.] - Additional Cost </li>
      </ol>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Other Income/Expense:</strong> Income and expenses generated or lost from sources not directly related to a business'
      core operations. Examples include income produced from the sale of assets or expenses accrued from lender fees due to overdrawing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When looking at or building/rebuilding a Chart of Accounts, a good base structure to use would be the following numbering
        sequencing. This will help keep a your categories together.</p>
      <table>
        <tr id="exprow1">
          <th class="accounts">Account Type</th>
          <th class="accounts">Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow2">
          <td class="accounts">Asset</td>
          <td class="accounts">1000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow3">
          <td class="accounts">Liability</td>
          <td class="accounts">2000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow4">
          <td class="accounts">Equity</td>
          <td class="accounts">3000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow5">
          <td class="accounts">Revenue</td>
          <td class="accounts">4000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow6">
          <td class="accounts">Direct Expense</td>
          <td class="accounts">5000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow7">
          <td class="accounts">Indirect Expense</td>
          <td class="accounts">6000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow8">
          <td class="accounts">Overhead Expense</td>
          <td class="accounts">7000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="exprow9">
          <td class="accounts">Other Income/Expense</td>
          <td class="accounts">8000+</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>1. Which accounts should be combined into a single account? What is the new
        account name and number?</p>
